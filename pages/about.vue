          <p class="pb-3">With a range of musical instruments, textures, music, sights, and smells, there is so much for Tiny Stompers to explore! Each session provides a multi-sensory environment aiding in children's development in many different and beneficial ways.</p>
          <p class="pb-3">Children are encouraged to move freely and take the lead in activities allowing them to decide what inspires them. Session activity examples include bubbles, ribbons sticks and pompoms, music, dancing, parachute, balancing and much more. We also celebrate themes such as Teddy Bear's Picnic, World Book Day, big box play, World Wildlife day, National Science Week, recycling and other excitingthemes.</p>
